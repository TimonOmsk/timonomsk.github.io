  You won't find any of my projects in open source. It's not because I'm a lazy person :) 
  I would better make some additional stuff for my main job(helpful utils, research, experiments).
  My job is always my hobby and I will do my best to achieve my current project's goals. 
  Achieving <mark>result</mark> is the main motivation for me.
