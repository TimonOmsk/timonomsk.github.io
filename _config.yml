  Hi, my name's Dmitry and I'm a <mark>Java Developer</mark> with a good <mark>leaderpship</mark> and <mark>soft skills</mark>. 

  My hard skills strengths
  * Good knowledge of the JVM platform. Including <mark>JMM</mark> <mark>Multithreading</mark> <mark>Collections</mark>
  * I'm not afraid of <mark>legacy code</mark>(although as a typical developer I prefer the greenfield projects). 
  * I like to explore new technologies, and because of that I have wide knowledge in other programming languages(<mark>Javascript</mark> <mark>C#</mark> <mark>Lua</mark>)
    
  My soft skills strengths 
  * <mark>Leadership</mark>
  * <mark>Responsibility</mark>. And by "responsibility" I mean that I'm ready to take responsibility for a feature, for a team, for a project.
  * I tried the different versions of <mark>Scrum</mark> :) From ScrumBut to canonical Scrum
  * I made about 100 <mark>interviews</mark> for java developer position(with different seniority level, from juniors to seniors)
  * Experience in <mark>team transformation</mark>
  * Experience in <mark>building a team</mark>(and a project) from the scratch

  A little bit of personal philosophy
  
  The main motivation for me is a result. If something should be done to move a project forward - I will do it.
  Develop some new features, refactor legacy code, meeting facilitation, junior developers mentoring, making analytical research. It doesn't matter. 
  If it helps my team if it helps my project if it helps my company. I will do it.

  You won't find any of my projects in open source. It's not because I'm a lazy person :) 
  I would better make some additional stuff for my main job(helpful utils, research, experiments).
  My job is always my hobby and I will do my best to achieve my current project's goals. 
  
  But job is not the only thing that I like :) So here is some things that I like besides my job
  * Collectible card games like Magic The Gathering, Gwent.  
  * Cars. I really enjoy driving. I can spend hours just driving around the city. 
  * My family :)
