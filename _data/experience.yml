    Project for communications between the bank and Federal tax department

    From the tech side it was a typical enterprise project with Spring and Hibernate on the backend and HTML, CSS, Jquery on the frontend. Nothing special, no rocket science.
    The most interesting part here was Scrum. Or rather that it was a great team of professionals with a project which was perfectly suitable for Scrum.
    Really amazing experience with canonical Scrum. This experience gave me understanding of how Scrum should work and what type of projects are fits Scrum best.
